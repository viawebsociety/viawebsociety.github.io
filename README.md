This is the home repository for the VIA Web Society web site project.

VIA Web Society is an open group for students at VIA University Horsens, who are interested in learning and discussing everything to do with the web. 

Our primary mission is to provide a practical outlet for learning skills crucial for work in the modern web industry, but not typically covered in class. We use Git and GitHub for collaboration, follow Responsive design and development practices, and treat HTML, CSS and JS with the love and respect they deserve.

If you are a VIA Horsens student and would like to join the project, please file an Issue in this repo with your GitHub username and your VIA student id number.
